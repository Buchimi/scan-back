# Scan Back
Scan back is an app that helps users find savings they never knew they could.
The main idea is that Walmart has a program, where users can receive cashback
if they bought goods in stores that are more expensive than the online version.

## How it works
Users of scanback have to scan a reciept of their purchases and our powerful API powered by flask and mongodb handle the automated process of finding these cashback opportunities and tallying them on the app

## Technologies used
We made use of Streamlit to create graph information for our web interface
React Native and Expo powers the mobile application
Flask is used as our API driver. 
Mongodb is our database infrastructure.
Optical Character Recognition with EdenAI API and OpenCV to dewarp and process images of receipts
We used Selenium for web scraping

## Where we go from here
- We could automate the process of getting a cashback from Walmart or other large retailers by exposing our API to their software
- We could partner with large retailers to give individuals discounts on online purchases using an in app e commerce store
